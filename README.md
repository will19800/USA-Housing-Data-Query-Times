# USA-Housing-Data-Query-Times

## Description
The goal of this project is to analyze and optimize query times for different types of data queries using Apache Spark on the USA Housing Market Dataset. The project aims to analyze 3 subets of data in the full dataset, which are zip code, crime rate, and price. The end goal is to understand how crime influences property value and is valuable in housing market analysis, real estate investment decisions, and neighborhood planning. This project implements queries using two APIs:

Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) API
Dataframe API / Spark SQL
